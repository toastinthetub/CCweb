<h1><p align="center">Barebones rust HTTP server for the Camas Codes website :-)</p></h1>
<h3><p align="center">this is an http (s) server! eventually this will flesh out into a nice and secure API<br>for the kind users of the CC website! This project will use no database<br>libraries or anything of the sort...just some CSV and a dream ðŸ’¯</p></h3>

<h3><p align="left"></p>I don't know why you'd ever need to run this, but in case you ever want to...</h3><h4>clone the repo!<br><code>git clone https://github.com/toastinthetub/CCweb/</code><br>then cd -> the project...<br><code>cd CCweb</code><br>and then run the fucker<br><code>cargo run --release</code><br></h4><h3>happy serving. some day i'll encrypt this.</h3>
